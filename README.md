# chat-server

This is the chat-server project. I did this project to write a chat-server from scratch.

It has two components:
1. Chat server
2. Chat client

To compile both server and client for testing:
```bash
cmake --build --preset=dev # compiles both server and client
```

Run server in one terminal window:
```bash
./build/dev/chat-server
```

Run multiple clients in each terminal window:
```bash
./build/dev/chat-client
```
